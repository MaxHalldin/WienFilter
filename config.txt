PLOT_EVERY: 10                      #    - Determines how often the heatmap plot should be updated when running a parameter mapping..
                                    #           For example, PLOT_EVERY: 5 means the plot is updated every fifth measurement.
                                    #           Set to 1 to update every measurement, or to 0 (or None) to disable live plotting.
                                    #           (i.e. only show plot when done).

                                    #           (this allows scales that include zero or even negative numbers.) Set to 0 if you only.
